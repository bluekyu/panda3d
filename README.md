# Building Panda3D
## Windows

I currently build using the Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and 2017 on Windows 10. (default is VS2017.)
Visual Studio 2015 and 2017 are binary compatible, so you can use any one.
(for example, you can use VS2017 with VS2015 binary version.)

You will also need to have the third-party dependency libraries available for
the build scripts to use. These are available from the URL,
depending on whether you are on a 32-bit or 64-bit system:
https://www.panda3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=18775

Note that those libraries are VS2015 version, but you can build with VS2017 as the mentioned above.
OR, you can build from my [panda3d-thirdparty](https://github.com/bluekyu/panda3d-thirdparty) repository.

After acquiring these dependencies, you may simply build Panda3D from CMake.

## Linux

See [README](https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d) in official repository. OR, you can use CMake.
